#User defined Objects Interning and Value Types in JAVA                          

Working on [JDK Enhancement proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDK_Enhancement_Proposal) (JEP) [401](https://openjdk.org/jeps/401) and [402](https://openjdk.org/jeps/402), under the guidance of Professor [V. Krishna Nandivada](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MTY=), at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. 

This is my ongoing final year research project under the name [‘Project Valhalla’](https://www.jesperdj.com/2015/10/04/project-valhalla-value-types/).

We want to mimic the behaviour of String Constant Pool, Heap Memory and String.intern() for user defined objects in Java                                                                                             

Steps to Run the code

1. Put all the files in one folder
2. Run .java files to see the output
 
 UGRC_code_1.java contains code before interning
 UGRC_code_2.java contains code after interning

JDK used - 17.0.4.1 2022-08-18 LTS
